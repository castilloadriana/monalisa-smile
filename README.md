## TL;DR Exhibition Wellesley College Fall 2024


History, speculation, and technology have continually shaped our interpretations of the Mona Lisa. Through an interactive narrative, the work challenges perceptions of identity, mystery, and interpretation, inviting users to engage with the painting in new and unexpected ways. Ultimately, it asks: how does our obsession with the Mona Lisa alter the way we see it? Overanalysis risks distorting art’s essence—what defines greatness: the art itself, or what we project onto it?




## Too Long ; Didn't Read

In a world shaped by convenience people became increasingly dependent on technology to handle even the smallest tasks. Complex articles were skimmed or skipped altogether, often considered too dense for a quick read. Long-form content became a thing of the past as everything was shortened into bite-sized snippets. Most users didn't bother engaging deeply, favoring quick scrolls and swipes to satisfy their need for information. Even books were distilled into summaries so readers could read less and still feel informed. In this new age, attention spans dwindled, leaving true understanding as little more than a forgotten art.

In the age of endless scrolling- where the world is at our fingertips and attention spans are cut short- boredom sets in too quickly. We often rush past the art we encounter, never taking the time to truly appreciate it. 

Is art still considered art if we don't have the time to enjoy it? 

This exhibition invites you to pause, reflect, and slow down to truly experience the creativity on display. Join us as we explore what happens when we take a moment to stop... and look. [too long didn't read ]
